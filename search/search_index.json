Consider m observations, with n outcomes. For example, one might model the number of faculty (outcome n=1) and students (outcome n=2) at 100 universities. We model these in a correlated framework because it is reasonable to assume that the number of faculty at a university is likely correlated with the number of students. Returning to the general case with m observations and n outcomes, in the linear context, we assume that the mean of the outcome is a function of the covariates for this outcome X_{i,j} , the coefficients to be estimated for this outcome \\beta{j} , and a random effect U_{i,j} E[Y_{i,j}|X_{i,j}, \\beta, U_{i,j}] = X_{i,j} \\beta_{j} + U_{i,j} for the i^{th} observation and the j^{th} outcome, where \\epsilon_{i} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) but with the additional assumption that the U_{i,} are multivariate normal, with mean 0 and covariance given by D .
