# Welcome to CorrelatedCounts

## Getting Started

In order to run the correlated count models, you will need to install Python to your computer. It is most helpful to use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), and then create an environment that will be used specifically with the correlated count package. The dependencies for this package are `numpy` and `scipy`.

```
git clone https://github.com/mbannick/CorrelatedCounts.git
